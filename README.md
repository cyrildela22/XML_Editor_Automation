# XML_Editor_Automation
## Problem Overview
During my internship at NYL, I identified a significant challenge that presented an opportunity to enhance team efficiency by up to 70%. This problem centered around the manual editing process of an essential XML file used to illustrate policyholder inforce information, specifically within the context of policy changes. The need for frequent manual editing not only consumed valuable time but also introduced the risk of data corruption due to inadvertent errors.

## Problem Identification:
The core issue revolved around the team's reliance on the TX203 XML file for representing policyholder inforce information. The file often required manual adjustments, particularly when policyholders underwent insurance policy changes. Team members engaged in the laborious task of manually inspecting and modifying the XML file's content, identifying fields requiring updates. This manual approach proved cumbersome, prone to human error, and susceptible to data corruption. Even the slightest accidental alteration risked rendering the XML file unusable, hampering its import into the illustration system and potentially disrupting critical operations.


## Challenges of Manual Editing:
The challenges of manual XML file editing were multi-fold. The process demanded meticulous attention to detail, as any unintended modifications could jeopardize the entire file's integrity. The reliance on human interpretation introduced inconsistencies in editing practices, leading to potential discrepancies in the final edited XML. Moreover, the lack of a standardized procedure exacerbated the risk of data corruption, requiring additional time and resources for error rectification.

In response to these challenges, I proposed the integration of an AI-driven solution to automate the editing process, offering accuracy, efficiency, and reduced operational risk. I programmed create a user-friendly tool to meet the demand of my team. This solution not only streamlined editing but also led to the development of a graphical user interface (UI) accessible to all team members, eliminating the need for specialized Python knowledge. The project culminated in the successful conversion of the Python code into an executable (exe) file, resulting in a remarkable time-saving achievement of approximately 70% for team members engaged in policy editing tasks.
